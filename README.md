# Ultimate UX Design + Build Team Challenge

##Fitness App for Runners

###Design Comp

While designing a comp for this app, our target audience needed to first be established. We felt that keeping a fitness app relatively simple by tailoring it to a specific audience would be beneficial. We wanted to allow a niche market or group of people to enjoy its features rather than a more broadly defined audience that may not enjoy all of the features, potentially ending up with more users who may not use the app as much. We have designed a go-to app that can be used frequently for the average or serious runner.

Any user that loves running and wants to log, track, or record daily runs with an ability to set and meet goals would be happy to use this app. Therefore, some components we decided to include are a calendar in which days could be broken down into details about a run:

**Daily goals juxtaposed to weekly and monthly goals**	- actual distance covered vs. goal (daily) + boolean (on track/not)
	- actual time spent running vs. goal (recorded time vs pace/mi)
	- Calories burned per day (1mi = 0.75 cal/weight)

This project was setup for us to work through the life cycle of a project brief: design, build, and client review/critique. Each of the “project life cycle stages” was broken out as a phase of the project, including one week to complete each phase. 

In week 1, we generated wireframes and a comp in Sketch. Final comps are to include mobile and desktop layouts and button/hover/active/ states--ready to hand-off to a deve team to build. In week 2, we switched comps with another team to build. In week 3, we participated in a formal group critique of both comps and static sites lead by our instructors at Turing.

The puropose of this project was to empathize more with a designer's process and choices and with the developer who is responsible for understanding and building a comp handed to them by a designer. We intended to build a greater understanding around why design/UX matters, why it is important to understand the thinking behind a layout, follow a comp to the letter, and explain and defend our design choices which will reinforce that the decisions that go into creating a layout are intentional, deliberate, and important.
